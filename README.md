QGis-R
======

Set of "sextante" R scripts for QGIS. The scripts implement several functionalities of project SENSUM packages. 
In particular, GenerateFocusMaps.rsx is a wrapper of R package "focusmapr" for the creation of Focus Maps. It allows, from within QGis (>2.0) for the generation of raster Focus Maps from a number (<4) of raster input layers. 

Installation (linux): copy all files to the folder ~/.qffis2/processing/rscripts, restart QGis.

Dependencies: in order to work, R (>3.0) must be installed, and several packages must be available as well.
